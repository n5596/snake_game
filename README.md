# Simple Snake Game written in C++

This is a simple implmentation of the classic snake game. The snake tries to eat as many fruits as it can without hitting the walls of the grid. For every fruit that the snake eats, it grows longer and the score increments by 10.

To run:

    g++ snake_game.cpp -o snake
    ./snake

Controls:

    a -> move left
    s -> move down
    w -> move up
    d -> move right
    x -> exit game
